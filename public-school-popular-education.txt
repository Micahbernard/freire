This statement proposes a reflection around the relation between *public education* and *popular education*.

It does not propose a thinking about *public education* in itself or *popular education* alone, but about each one in relation to the other.

In essence, the statement implies an inquiry that may possibly be made explicit as such: is it possible to make popular education in the public school system? Or, conversely, to state in advance: popular education can realize itself only in the space of informality, in the political-pedagogical practice outside the school, inside popular movements.
