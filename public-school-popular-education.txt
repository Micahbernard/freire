This statement proposes a reflection around the relation between *public education* and *popular education*.

It does not propose a thinking about *public education* in itself or *popular education* alone, but about each one in relation to the other.

In essence, the statement implies an inquiry that may be elucidated as such: is it possible to make popular education in the public school system? Or, conversely, to state my thesis right away: popular education can realize itself only in the space of informality, in the political-pedagogical practice outside the school, inside popular movements.

My starting point to respond to those inquiries is the critical comprehension of educational practice.

There is no educational practice, as with any practice, that escapes limits. Ideological, epistemological, political, economic, cultural limits.

I believe the best statement to define the reach of educational practice in view of its limits is the following: *unable of everything, educational practice is able of something*.

This statement refuses, on one hand, the naive optimism that believes education is the key to social transformations, the solution for all problems; on the other hand, the equally uncritical and mechanistic pessimism that believes education, while superstructure, is only able of something after infrastructural transformations.
